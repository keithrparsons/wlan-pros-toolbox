// Wi-Fi monitoring state machine (TICKET-03 A2).
//
// Drives the Wi-Fi Details screen over the [WiFiDetailsBridge]. It owns the
// honest install-state branch, the one-shot pull, and the live push stream, so
// the widget stays thin and the state machine is unit-testable without a widget
// tree. Exposed as a [ChangeNotifier].
//
// Phases:
//   loading      -> resolving install-state + latest payload on first load.
//   needsInstall -> no payload has ever arrived: show install / how-to.
//   idleWithData -> at least one payload exists, live monitoring not running.
//   streaming    -> live monitoring running; cards update on each pushed payload.
//
// The one-shot path (run the Shortcut once -> single update) stays first-class:
// a payload delivered while idle moves the screen to [idleWithData] with data.
